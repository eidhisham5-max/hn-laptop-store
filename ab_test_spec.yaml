# HYPOTHESIS & OBJECTIVES
# =====================================================

hypothesis:
  primary: "Changing the primary CTA button color from blue (#0B6DF3) to orange (#FF6A00) will increase add-to-cart conversion rate by at least 0.5 percentage points due to improved visual contrast and urgency perception."
  
  secondary_hypotheses:
    - "Orange buttons will perform better on mobile devices due to higher thumb accessibility"
    - "Arabic users will show stronger preference for orange due to cultural color associations"
    - "Higher-priced products will benefit more from orange CTA buttons"
  
  rationale: |
    Based on NeuroBehavioral Design principles:
    1. Perceptual Layer: Orange provides higher contrast against white backgrounds
    2. Cognitive Layer: Orange is associated with urgency and action
    3. Affective Layer: Orange evokes excitement and enthusiasm
    4. Previous industry studies show 15-25% improvement with warm CTA colors

business_objectives:
  primary: "Increase add-to-cart conversion rate"
  secondary:
    - "Improve mobile user experience"
    - "Enhance brand differentiation"
    - "Validate design system color choices"
  
  success_criteria:
    - "Statistically significant improvement in add-to-cart rate"
    - "No negative impact on overall user experience metrics"
    - "Positive qualitative feedback from user interviews"
